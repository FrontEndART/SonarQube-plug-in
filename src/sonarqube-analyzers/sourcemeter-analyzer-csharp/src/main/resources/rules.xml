    <name>Lack of Cohesion in Methods 5 (LCOM5) Metric Threshold Violation</name>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Class, Structure:&lt;/strong&gt; number of functionalities of the class. One of the basic principles of object-oriented programming is encapsulation, meaning that attributes belonging together and the operations that use them should be organized into one class, and one class shall implement only one functionality, i.e. its attributes and methods should be coherent. This metric measures the lack of cohesion and computes into how many coherent classes the class could be split. It is calculated by taking a non-directed graph, where the nodes are the implemented local methods of the class and there is an edge between the two nodes if and only if a common (local or inherited) attribute or abstract method is used or a method invokes another. The value of the metric is the number of connected components in the graph except the ones that contain only constructors, destructors, getters or setters – as they are integral parts of the class.&lt;/p&gt;&#x0A;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method:&lt;/strong&gt; complexity of the method expressed as the number of independent control flow paths in it. It represents a lower bound for the number of possible execution paths in the source code and at the same time it is an upper bound for the minimum number of test cases needed for achieving full branch test coverage. The value of the metric is initially 1 which increases by 1 for each occurence of the following instructions: if, for, foreach, while, do-while, case label (label that belongs to a switch instruction), catch (handler that belongs to a try block), conditional statement (?:) and conditional access operators (?. and ?[]). Moreover, logical and (&amp;amp;&amp;amp;), logical or (||) and null coalescing (??) expressions also add to the final value because their short-circuit evalutaion can cause branching depending on the first operand. The following language elements do not increase the value: else, try, switch, default label (default label that belongs to a switch instruction), finally.&lt;/p&gt;&#x0A;</description>

Asserts without security checks are only permissible when you are certain that the assert cannot be used in a harmful fashion, namely, if the code you call is harmless, or users have no way to pass arbitrary information to code that you call.</description>

    <description>&lt;h3&gt;FxCop&lt;/h3&gt;Use of IntPtr in managed code may indicate a potential security and reliability problem. All uses of IntPtr must be reviewed to determine whether use of a SafeHandle (or similar technology) is required in its place. Problems will occur if the IntPtr represents some native resource (memory, file handle, socket etc.) that managed code is considered to own. I.e. managed code is expected to in some way release the resource and failure to do so would cause resource leakage. In such scenarios security or reliability problems will also exist if multithreaded access is allowed to the IntPtr and a means of releasing the resource represented by the IntPtr. These problems involve recycling of the IntPtr value on resource release while simultaneous use of the resource is being made on another thread, leading to race conditions where one thread can read or write data associated with the wrong resource. For example, if your type stores an OS handle as an IntPtr and allows users to call both Close and any other method using that handle simultaneously (without some kind of synchronization), your code has a handle recycling problem, which causes data corruption and often a security vulnerability. SafeHandle (and its sibling class CriticalHandle) provide a mechanism for encapsulating a native handle to a resource so that such threading problems can be avoided (along with other issues such as the need to carefully control the lifetime of managed objects that contain a copy of the native handle over calls to native methods; ie, you can often remove calls to GC.KeepAlive). There are performance overheads implicit in using SafeHandle (and, to a lesser degree, CriticalHandle) which can often be mitigated through careful design.</description>
