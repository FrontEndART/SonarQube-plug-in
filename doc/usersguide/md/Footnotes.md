# Footnotes

[^1]: This version of the plug-in was successfully tested with the platform version 6.7.

[^2]: Project dependent setting pages are available only when a project is selected.

[^3]: More precisely, if the plug-in is installed for a language it will calculate metrics, code duplications, and coding rule violations (as it is described in the SourceMeter User's Guide) but for a language other plug-ins can be installed as well that, for example, can detect additional coding rule violations which will also be presented on the dashboard. Even more, if a multilingual project is analyzed where SourceMeter is not used for all languages of the project, the results will still be correct because the corresponding results will be aggregated properly.

[^4]: SourceMeter and all integrated coding issue detectors work on source code except FindBugs and FxCop that require Java byte code and .NET binaries with pdb files of the C# project, respectively.

[^5]: Smaller values mean better quality for all metrics, except API documentation (AD), Comment density (CD), and Total Comment density (TCD).
