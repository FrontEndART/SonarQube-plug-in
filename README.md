[![Maintainability](https://cloud.quality-gate.com/backend/api/badge?branchName=master&projectName=FrontEndART_SonarQube-plug-in)](https://www.quality-gate.com/dashboard/branches/465793)

*FrontEndART* **[SourceMeter]** is a command line source code analyzer tool, which can perform **deep static analysis** of the source code of complex software systems written in **C/C++**, **C#**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, **Python** and **RPG**. [FrontEndART] offers a **free version** of SourceMeter.

*SourceMeter plug-in for SONARQUBE™ platform* ("plug-in" in the following) is an extension of the open-source [SONARQUBE]™ platform ("platform" in the following) for managing code quality. The plug-in executes SourceMeter from the platform and uploads the source code analysis results of SourceMeter into the platform's database.

The plug-in is free and open-source, and provides all the usual platform code analysis results, extended with many additional metrics and issue detectors provided by the SourceMeter tool.

Additionally, the plug-in extends the platform's GUI with a SourceMeter dashboard view.

***Highlights*** of the added features:

- Precise C/C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Python and RPG source code analysis engines

- Package, class and method level analyses extending the directory and file-based approach

- More sophisticated syntax-based duplicated code detection engine (Type-2 clones)

- Additional and more precise source code metrics (100+) including metrics related to clones

- Powerful coding issue detection

- Custom dashboard for packages, classes, methods and clone classes/instances

- CloneViewer for comparing and managing code duplications

- And many more...

The plug-in is compatible with the latest LTS version 7.9[^1], which can be obtained from its [website].
