# FrontEndART SourceMeter plug-in for SONARQUBE™ platform

*FrontEndART* **[SourceMeter]** is a command line source code analyzer tool, which can perform **deep static analysis** of the source code of complex software systems written in **C/C++**, **C#**, **Java**, **Python**, and **RPG**. [FrontEndART] offers also a **free version** of SourceMeter.

*SourceMeter plug-in for SONARQUBE™ platform* ("plug-in" in the following) is an extension of the open-source [SONARQUBE]™ platform for managing code quality. The plug-in executes SourceMeter from the SONARQUBE™ platform and uploads the source code analysis results of SourceMeter into the SONARQUBE™ database.

The plug-in is open-source, and provides all the usual SONARQUBE™ code analysis results, extended with many additional metrics and issue detectors provided by the SourceMeter tool. The plug-in supports the C/C++, C#, Java, Python and RPG languages.

Additionally, the plug-in extends the SONARQUBE™ platform GUI with new features on the dashboard and drill-down views.
